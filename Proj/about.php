  <h1>About Us</h1><br>
  <h2>We are a group of students with a vision to contribute as much as we can to our society in any way we can. 
    When the opportunity was presented to us to develop a project as part of the final semester in our course, we brainstormed various different ideas for project which can actually make a difference in todayâ€™s world. 
    We finally stumbled upon the idea for a web app which can connect donors to various charity organizations or NGOs in situations like when there is abundant food available from celebrations, functions etc. We wanted to establish a proper channel between the donors and volunteers who were ready to distribute the available items to the ones in need. 
    With our past experience and help from proper resources, we made this idea possible with dedication and hard work.
    All along this projects development we had only one thing in our minds:
   <h2> A better solution for a better tomorrow.<h2>
